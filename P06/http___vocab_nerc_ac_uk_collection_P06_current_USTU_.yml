  original: Standardised scale for nephelometric measurement of turbidity calibrated
    against formazine solutions of different concentration and measured using a white
    light source at a 90 degree detection angle. Earlier measurements of turbidity
    tended to use NTU (sometimes also labelled STU or FTU) as the unit regardless
    of the measurement method.
