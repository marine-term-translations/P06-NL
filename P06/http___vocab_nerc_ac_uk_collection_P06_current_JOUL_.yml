  original: A derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal
    to the energy transferred (or work done) when applying a force of one newton through
    a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or Nm), or in passing an electric current
    of one ampere through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after
    the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818-1889).
